This folder structure should be suitable for starting a project that uses a database:

* Fork this repo
* Clone this repo
* Run `bundle install` to install `active_record`
* `rake generate:migration <NAME>` to create a migration (Don't include the `<` `>` in your name, it should also start with a capital)
* `rake db:migrate` to run the migration and update the database
* Create models in lib that subclass `ActiveRecord::Base`
* ... ?
* Profit
